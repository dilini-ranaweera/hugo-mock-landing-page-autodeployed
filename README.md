# hugo-mock-landing-page

Hello! This is my mock landing page made with the Hugo static site generator. I created it for the product JetSet.ai, which is an AI powered travel assistant application. All the relevant features can be found in the USER-STORIES.md file. 

# Autodeployment workflow:
-any time a commit occurs the changes are automatically renderd on https://dilini-ranaweera.github.io/hugo-mock-landing-page-autodeployed. This is done through the use of github actions and the workflow found in .github/workflows. You can view stats with the workflow in the actions tab in the repository.
